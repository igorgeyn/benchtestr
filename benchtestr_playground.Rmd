## What is this?

This .RMD serves to play around with `benchtestr` a bit. We can then translate some of this into our vignette, etc.

### Example 1

Let's try some of our toy functions just to make sure they work!

```{r}

adding_two(15)

story_mod(50)

# this is going to create a global object called `df_out`
dplyr_manip(df = nsw_dehejia_wahba, var_half = 're78', var_double = 're74')

head(df_out)
summary(df_out$var_half_new)
summary(df_out$var_double_new)

```

```{r}

library(rlang)

### trying out the naive_dim estimator

type_explorer <- function(df1, df2, treatment, outcome) {
  
  treatment_sym = sym(treatment)
  outcome_sym = sym(outcome)
  
  treatment_quo = quo(treatment_sym)
  outcome_quo = quo(outcome_sym)
  
  # print(df1)
  # print(df2)
  # print(treatment)
  # print(outcome)
  # 
  # print(treatment_sym)
  # print(outcome_sym)
  
  # print(treatment_quo)
  # print(outcome_quo)
  print(quo_get_expr(treatment_quo))
  print(quo_get_expr(outcome_quo))
  
  # print(class(df1))
  # print(class(df2))
  # print(class(treatment))
  # print(class(outcome))
  # print(class(treatment_sym))
  # print(class(outcome_sym))
  # print(class(treatment_quo))
  # print(class(outcome_quo))
  
}

type_explorer(df1 = nsw_dehejia_wahba, df2 = nsw_psid_control,
              treatment = 'treat', outcome = 're78')

length_getter <- function(df1, df2, treatment, outcome,
                          df_string) {
  
  # get length of treated and control in df1

  # need to input treatment_length fxn here

  dim_estimate1 <<- dim_estimator_df1$avg_earnings[2] - dim_estimator_df1$avg_earnings[1]
  se_dim <<- sqrt((dim_estimator_df1[1,3]/length(df1$quo(treatment)[df1$quo(treatment) == 1])) +
                    (dim_estimator_df1[2,3]/length(df1$quo(treatment)[df1$quo(treatment) == 0])))

```{r}
  # create the df of treatment-only from df1

## Installing `benchtestr`

Does it work? Let's find out.

```{r}

remotes::install_github("igorgeyn/benchtestr/benchtestr")

```


## Data on negative campaign ads

Pulling in data on negative campaign ads from Experimental estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects related to self-selection.

```{r}

# install.packages('Rtools')
library(devtools)

install.packages('GK2011')
library('GK2011')

remotes::install_github("leeper/GK2011") # gotta check on these errors at some point
data(ajps)

head(ajps)

```

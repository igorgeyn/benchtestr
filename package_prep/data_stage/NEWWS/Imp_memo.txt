                               HOW MDRC ESTIMATED IMPACTS


***********************************************************************************************************;


/*  FOR ALL SITES: */

This is the standard list of baseline demographic covariates for the impact regression model:



                MARSTAT    /* SINGLE PARENT, EVER MARRIED */
                TWOCHILD   /* TWO CHILDREN                */
                THRCHILD   /* THREE OR MORE CHILDREN      */
                CHLD0T5    /* ANY CHILD 0-5 YEARS OLD     */
                BLACK      /* BLACK                       */
                NOTBW      /* NOT BLACK OR WHITE          */
                AGEP       /* AGE AT RANDOM ASSIGNMENT    */
                FEMALE     /* FEMALE                      */
                HSDIP      /* HS DIPLOMA-GED              */  ;

Some sample members have missing values for these measures. These must be imputed prior
to calculating impacts.  The public use file contains imputed values for these measures
based on mean substitution by site and the sample member's educational attainment at
random assignment.  (The imputed values are decimals between 0 and 1.)  If you choose to
use MDRC's imputations, substitute


               XMARSTAT    /* SINGLE PARENT, EVER MARRIED */
               XTWOCHLD    /* TWO CHILDREN                */
               XTHRCHLD    /* THREE OR MORE CHILDREN      */
               XCHLD0T5    /* ANY CHILD 0-5 YEARS OLD     */
               XBLACK      /* BLACK                       */
               XNOTBW      /* NOT BLACK OR WHITE          */
               XAGEP       /* AGE AT RANDOM ASSIGNMENT    */

               XHSDIP      /* HS DIPLOMA-GED              */  ;

/* IMPORTANT:
MDRC changed the values of some covariates on the public use version of the
file to protect sample members' confidentiality.  (See N5PI_CBK.TXT for details)
*/



/* COVARIATES CALCULATED FROM ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS */

This is the standard list of covariates created from administrative records:


                YREMP      /*  EMPLOYED IN YEAR PRIOR TO RA?               */
                EMPPQ1     /*  EMPLOYED IN PRE-RA QUARTER 1                */
                YREARN     /*  YEAR PRIOR TO RA EARNINGS                   */
                YREARNSQ   /*  YEAR PRIOR TO RA EARNINGS SQUARED           */
                PEARN1     /*  EARNINGS: RELATIVE PRE-RA QUARTER 1         */
                RECPC1     /*  RECEIVED AFDC IN FISC QTR 1 BEFORE RA       */
                YRREC      /*  RECEIVED AFDC DURING YEAR PRIOR TO RA?      */
                GYRADC     /*  AVG AFDC PER MTH RECVED YEAR PRIOR TO RA    */
                YRKREC     /*  # OF MTHS RECEIVED AFDC YEAR PRIOR TO RA    */
                YRRFS      /*  RECEIVED FOOD STAMPS YEAR PRIOR TO RA?      */
                GYRFS      /*  AVERAGE FOOD STAMPS PER MONTH RECEIVED      */
                YRKRFS     /*  NUMBER OF MONTHS RECEIVING FS PRIOR YEAR    */ ;

There are no missing values for these measures.

      TO ESTIMATE IMPACTS FOR THE RIVERSIDE LFA APPROACH:


*****************************************************************************************;


NOTE: Estimating impacts for Riverside LFA is relatively complex because Riverside's
      research design involved different sampling ratios for sample members determined

      to need basic education:       1/3 LFA   1/3  HCD    1/3 Control

      not to need basic education:   1/2 LFA     0  HCD    1/2 Control


Where need for basic education=

no high school diploma or GED certificate (HSDIP=0)

OR

below minimum score on baseline literacy test (LOWREAD=1)

OR

below minimum score on baseline math test (LOWMATH=1)

OR

non-English speaker (LIMENG=1)



In Riverside the proportion of in-need and not in-need for the full impact sample=

            19.18    40.66    40.16   100.00


It should be expected that impacts for LFA for the in-need group will differ from
impacts for the not-in-need group  (see impact tables).


IMPORTANT!!!:

To make the impacts for LFA generalizable to the full impact sample,
it is necessary to

1) Weight the results for in-need to equal 56.73 percent of the full sample impact

2) Weight the results for not-in-need to equal 43.27 percent of the full sample impact


NOTE: This weighting strategy should be repeated (but with different weights) when
running impacts for subgroups, because the proportions of in-need and not in-need will
vary.

There are a number of ways to implement this weighting strategy:



MDRC chose to apply the weights after impacts were run:



Select: ALPHSITE=7

Include all LFAs, HCDs, and control group members in the calculations.


Include an extra series of baseline demographic covariates:




        NEED           /* =1 if in-need of basic education     */



*MDRC 2/01 Variables in the NEEDCOV series will be part of the Riverside LFA
           regression model.  They should correspond exactly to the vars in the
           standard series except for HSDIP (see above note for more info).
           Whenever you add/delete vars to/from the standard list, be sure
           to also add/delete the corresponding vars to/from the extra list. ;

            FOR THE LFA APPROACH FOR SAMPLE MEMBERS IN NEED OF BASIC EDUCATION

       for more information.


**********************************************************************

    TO CALCULATE WEIGHTED IMPACTS, SIGNIFICANCE
    LEVELS, AND WEIGHTED MEANS FOR THE RIVERSIDE LFA PROGRAM.

*********************************************************************

    Let

    NJIMP =   the average impact for LFAs

    JinIMP=   the average impact for LFAs in need of basic education
              (the coefficient of JNEED)

    INNEEDWT= the proportion of the full sample
              in need of basic education (from MEANS output)

    JnoIMP=   the average impact for LFAs not in need of basic education
              (the coefficient of JNONEED)

    NONEEDWT= the proportion of the full sample
              not in need of basic education (from MEANS output)





Steps A and B calculate the weighted impact for LFAs


A.  The LFA impact is the weighted average of the in need
    LFA impact and the not in need LFA impact. You will need
    to calculate these weighted means with a spreadsheet, calculator, or
    through additional programming, using the following formulas:



    The  weighted LFA impact=

    NJIMP = (INNEEDWT*JINIMP) + (NONEEDWT*JNOIMP)





B.  To determine whether weighted impacts are significant, use the
    F statistic for the model that tests whether the weighted in need
    and not in need impacts are significant:

    TEST  INNEEDWT*JNEED + NONEEDWT*JNONEED = 0


Steps C through E calculate the adjusted means for control group members:

Let:
    CMEAN=    the adjusted mean for control group members

    CMEANIN=  the adjusted mean for control group members in need of basic education (NEED=1)

    CMEANNOT= the adjusted mean for control group members
              not in need of basic education (NEED=0)

    MEANNEED= the unadjusted mean of the dependent variable for all LFAs, HCDs, and
              control group members in need of basic education (NEED=1)

    MEANNOT=  the unadjusted mean of the dependent variable for all LFAs and
              control group members not in need of basic education (NEED=0)


    JINSHARE= the proportion of LFAs in the in-need sample (NEED=1)

    JNOSHARE= the proportion of LFAs in the not in-need sample (NEED=0)

    BIMP=     the average impact for HCDs  (the coefficient for BNEED)

    HCDSHARE= the proportion of HCDs in the in-need sample (NEED=1)




C.  Calculate the adjusted Control mean for the in need sample.
    Subtract the following from the mean of the in need sample:
    (See formula below.)

       (1) the proportion of LFAs in the in need sample multiplied by the
           impact for the in need sample, and

       (2) the proportion of HCDs in the in need sample multiplied by
           the HCD impact.

       CMEANIN = MEANNEED - (JINSHARE*JINIMP) - (HCDSHARE*BIMP)

D.  Calculate the adjusted Control mean for the not in need sample.
    Subtract the percent of LFAs in the not in need sample multiplied by the
    impact for the not in need sample from the mean of the not in
    need sample.

       CMEANNOT= MEANNOT  - (JNOSHARE*JNOIMP)

E.  Calculate the weighted Control mean for the full LFA sample.
    Add the control mean of the in need sample multiplied by the in
    need weight to the control mean of the not in need sample multiplied
    by the not in need weight.

       CMEAN = INNEEDWT*CMEANIN + NONEEDWT*CMEANNOT


Steps F through H calculate the adjusted means for LFAs:


Let:
    JMEAN=    the adjusted mean for all LFAs

    JMEANIN=  the adjusted mean for LFAs in need of basic education (NEED=1)

    JMEANNOT= the adjusted mean for LFAs not in need of basic education (NEED=0)


F. Calculate the adjusted LFA full sample mean. Add the weighted
   Control mean to the weighted LFA impact for the full sample.

     JMEAN = CMEAN + NJIMP


FYI:


G. Calculate the adjusted LFA mean for the in need sample. Add the
   adjusted Control mean of the in need sample to the in need LFA impact.

     JMEANIN = CMEANIN  + JINIMP

H. Calculate the adjusted LFA mean for the not in need sample. Add the
   adjusted Control mean of the not in need sample to the not in need
   LFA impact.

     JMEANNOT= CMEANNOT + JNOIMP



I. To calculate the percentage change of the impact (PJIMP) divide the weighted
   LFA impact by the weighted Control mean and multiply by 100.

          PJIMP = (NJIMP / CMEAN) * 100



NOTE: It is also possible to weight the sample ahead of time and run
PROC GLM weighted (in SAS) or its equivalent in other statistical packages.

The file includes the weight variable RILFACW with the following values for the
full sample:


The formula for the weight=   /* see table above */


HCDs:                    1.00

LFA IN-NEED:             56.73 / 46.87 = 1.21041266

LFA NOT-IN-NEED:         43.27 / 53.13 = 0.81439683

CONTROL IN NEED:         56.73 / 46.05 = 1.23189619

CONTROL NOT-IN-NEED:     43.27 / 53.95 = 0.80205865


After weighting LFAs and control group members have the same proportion of in-need and
not in-need as the full sample (LFA+HCD+control group combined).


But this weight variable can only be used for estimating impacts for the full sample.
A different weight would need to be calculated for estimating impacts for subgroups,
because the proportion of in-need and not in-need will vary.

MDRC deleted HSDIP from the standard list of baseline demographic covariates when
estimating impacts for HCD and LFA in-need. The vast majority  of in-need sample members
do not have a HS DIPLOMA or GED (HSDIP=0), and HSDIP is highly correlated with
other independent variables.  All other covars for Riverside HCDs are the same
as those of other sites.

For Detroit: Select ALPHSITE=3

For Oklahoma City: Select ALPHSITE=5

For Portland: Select ALPHSITE=6


**** MDRC 2/01

FOR PORTLAND ONLY:

Add to list of background demographic covariates:

PORTCOH2          /* randomly assigned after change in random assignment ratio   */




**** MDRC 2/01: RESEARCH GROUP DUMMY VARIABLES ;


                P          /*  PROGRAM GROUP                    */
                C2         /*  CONTROL GROUP                    */   ;






**** MDRC 2/01: CALCULATE THE MEANS OF DEPENDENT VARIABLES AND RESEARCH GROUP DUMMIES
                AND COVARIATES;


**** MDRC 2/01: MDRC RAN OLS REGRESSIONS;


[Dependent variable]= P  [baseline demographic covariates] [administrative records covariates]



**** MDRC 2/01
The regression coefficients associated with the dummy vaiable P shows
the impact of the Program on the program group.

To estimate adjusted means for each dependent variable:

1) Adjusted mean for control group=

ADJMEANC=

GDEPVAR -       (COEFOFP           * MEANOFP)

site mean       Program impact=    proportion
of dependent    coefficient        of P's in
variable        of P from          the sample=
from            regression         Mean of P
MEANS           output             from
output                             MEANS
                                   output


2) Adjusted mean for Program group=

ADJMEANP        =       ADJMEANC      +       COEFOFP

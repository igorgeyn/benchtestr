ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUTCOME MEASURES CALCULATED WITH ADMINISTRATIVE DATA


NOTE: Some of the measures described below are only available in the restricted
access version of the file, housed at the National Center for Health Statistics.
These will be indicated with: [N/A FOR PUF].

I. General information

Quarter 1 is the quarter of random assignment

MDRC did not include data for quarter 1 in impact estimates, because quarter
1 could include earnings or payments from months immediately preceding
random assignment. Thus:

Year 1= Q2  through Q5
Year 2= Q6  through Q9
Year 3= Q10 through Q13
Year 4= Q14 through Q17
Year 5= Q18 through Q21


II. Monthly outcomes (welfare and Food Stamps) [N/A FOR PUF]

Month 1= the month of random assignment

Monthly payment measures for the random assignment month or later
have an M in the variable name

ADCM1-ADCM63: total welfare payments, months 1-63  [N/A FOR PUF]

RECM1-RECM63: received a welfare payment, months 1-63  [N/A FOR PUF]

FSM1-FSM63:   total Food Stamps, months 1-63 [N/A FOR PUF]

RFSM1-RFS63:  received Food Stamps, months 1-63 [N/A FOR PUF]

Monthly payment measures for up to 24 months prior to the month of
random assignment have a PM in the variable name

ADCPM24 to ADCPM1: total welfare payments  [N/A FOR PUF]

FSPM24 to FSPM1: total Food Stamps  [N/A FOR PUF]


III. Summing monthly welfare and Food Stamps data into quarters


Monthly welfare and Food Stamp payment variables (FSPM24 TO FSM63 AND
ADCPM24 TO ADCM63) are shifted to match the months included in calendar
quarters. (This was done because UI earnings are reported quarterly.)
The shifted variables have an FM (fiscal month) in their variable name.

[All FM measuers: N/A FOR PUF]: These measures are used for summing welfare
and Food Stamp payments into quarterly and yearly totals.

For example:

   PERSON 1 IS RANDOMLY ASSIGNED ON APRIL 5, 1991.

   EARN1 SHOWS EARNINGS FOR APRIL THROUGH JUNE, 1991.

   ADCM1 THROUGH ADCM3 AND FSM1 THROUGH FSM3 SHOW PAYMENTS FOR APRIL, MAY,
   AND JUNE, 1991.

   NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS PERSON: ADCFM1=ADCM1, ADCFM2=ADCM2, ADCFM3=ADCM3,
   FSFM1=FSM1, FSFM2=FSM2, AND FSFM3=FSM3.

   BUT:


   PERSON 2 IS RANDOMLY ASSIGNED ON MAY 15, 1991.

   EARN1 SHOWS EARNINGS FOR APRIL THROUGH JUNE 1991.

   ADCM1 THROUGH ADCM3 AND FSM1 THROUGH FSM3 SHOW PAYMENTS FOR MAY, JUNE,
   AND JULY, 1991.

   HERE, THE FIRST QUARTER OF EARNINGS INCLUDES DIFFERENT MONTHS FROM THE
   FIRST 3 MONTHS OF AFDC AND FOOD STAMPS.

   THEREFORE: ADCFM1=ADCPM1 AND FSFM1=FSPM1 (PAYMENTS FOR APRIL 1991);
   ADCFM2=ADCM1 AND FSFM2=FSM1 (PAYMENTS FOR MAY 1991);
   ADCFM3=ADCM2 AND FSFM3=FSM2 (PAYMENTS FOR JUNE 1991);

   AND SO ON, BACKWARDS THROUGH PRIOR QUARTERS AND FORWARD THROUGH THE
   FOLLOW-UP.



   PERSON 3 IS RANDOMLY ASSIGNED ON JUNE 31, 1991.

   EARN1 SHOWS EARNINGS FOR APRIL THROUGH JUNE 1991.

   ADCM1 THROUGH ADCM3 AND FSM1 THROUGH FSM3 SHOW PAYMENTS FOR JUNE, JULY,
   AND AUGUST, 1991.

   HERE, THE FIRST QUARTER OF EARNINGS INCLUDES DIFFERENT MONTHS FROM THE
   FIRST 3 MONTHS OF AFDC AND FOOD STAMPS.

   THEREFORE: ADCFM1=ADCPM2 AND FSFM1=FSPM2 (PAYMENTS FOR APRIL 1991);
   ADCFM2=ADCPM1 AND FSFM2=FSPM1 (PAYMENTS FOR MAY 1991);
   ADCFM3=ADCM1 AND FSFM3=FSM1 (PAYMENTS FOR JUNE 1991);


NOTE: MDRC considered fiscal month 4 (first month of the calendar quarter
following random assignment) as the start month for summing welfare and
Food Stamp payments or for counting months of receipt after random
assignment.

VIII.  Estimating EITC


The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is available to low-income working
taxpayers.  Three factors determine the amount of the credit:

        1) the gross taxable income of the taxpayer (EARN...)
        2) the year in which the credit was issued
        3) the number of children the taxpayer has  (CHCNT)

MDRC applied the rules for calculating EITC (obtained from the Green
Books for 1996, 1998, and 1999).


EITC varies according to three different scenarios:

        1)  If earnings are less than or equal to the minimum income at
            which the maximum credit can be received, then the EITC
            equals the credit rate times earnings.

        2)  If earnings are greater than the minimum income at which
            the maximum credit can be received yet less than or equal to
            the  beginning of the phase-out range, then the EITC equals the
            maximum credit rate.

        3)  If earnings fall within the phase-out range, then the
            EITC equals the maximum credit rate minus a certain percentage
            (the phase-out rate) of income above the beginning of the range.

For example, taxpayers with one child in 1996 could claim a credit in
1996 of 34 percent (the credit rate) of their earnings up to $6,330,
resulting in a maximum credit of $2,152.  The maximum credit was available
for those with earnings between $6,330 and $11,610.  At $11,610 of earnings
the credit began to phase down at a rate of 15.98 percent of the amount of
earnings above that amount.  The credit was phased down to 0 at $25,078
(1996 Green Book, page 804).

MDRC based the value of each sample member's EITC on her total earnings for
each follow-up year (EARNQ2T5, EARNQ6T9, EARN1013, EARN1417, EARN1821).
MDRC applied the rules for calculating the EITC for the calendar year in
which the 3rd quarter of each follow-up year occurred.

More specifically:

         Includes  Reference
         Quarters  Quarter
Year 1   2 - 5          4
Year 2   6 - 9          8
Year 3  10 -13         12
Year 4  14 -17         16
Year 5  18 -21         20


As we were unsure how many sample members actually received EITC (the
credit is not automatically issued to eligible taxpayers but must be
requested), we estimated the take-up rate (percentage of employed sample
members who received the EITC):

For the primary analyses, we assumed an 80 percent take-up rate,
based on John Karl Scholz, "In-Work Benefits in the United States:
The Earned Income Tax Credit," Economic Journal 106 (January, 1996):
156-169.

When creating the EITC measures, we multiplied each sample member's
estimated EITC by 0.8.



IX. Estimating income above poverty


The poverty threshold is determined by the U.S. Census Bureau.  It
is updated annually and varies by family size.

Dummy variables were created that indicate what percent of the poverty
threshold total income represented.  Sample members with more than three
children were assigned the same poverty thresholds as those with exactly
three children.  Sample members with no children were treated like those
with one child.

It should be noted that these estimates differ from official estimates of
poverty because here income includes Food Stamps and (for some measures)
payroll taxes, which are left out of official income calculations used to
determine the poverty threshold, and excludes otehr sources that are
typically counted.

The method for assigning poverty levels (POVLVLyy) is similar to that for
EITC in that it is based on when qtr 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 occur.  (see above
for details).

Next, sample members' income was expressed as a percentage of the poverty
threshold.  As noted above, different income was calculated in different
ways, and different comparisons of income to poverty were made.


X. Employment retention and advancement outcomes


A. Employment spells: A spell is a continuous series of quarters with earnings
greater than $0.

EMPSPL   = Number of employment spells in years 1 to 5  (range: 1 to 8)

KEMPSPn  = Number of quarters in employment spell N     (range: 1 to 20)

SEMPSPn  = Starting quarter of employment spell N       (range: 2 to 21)

EEMPSPn  = Ending quarter of employment spell N         (range: 2 to 21)


B. Average earnings per quarter of employment by follow-up year

GERNqqqq = average earnings per quarter of employment  (year 3, year 4, year 5)


C. Additional employment retention measures


VEM9QY35 = Employed at least 9 (of 12) quarters in years 3 to 5

VEM9QN35 = Employed after random assignment but less than 9 quarters in years
           3 to 5

EYNEMP21 = Employed after random assignment but not employed in quarter 21 (last
           quarter of year 5)



D. Earnings growth

In the NEWWS Final Report, earnings growth was measured by comparing the
earnings of a sample member's first "measured" quarter of employment - i.e., a
quarter that did not begin or end an employment spell - and her last
"measured" quarter of employment. For sample members with 4 or more measured
quarters of employment, the average of the first two and the last two quarters
were compared.  No calculation was made if the sample member never worked for
pay after random assignment or had 0 or 1 measured quarters of employment.


TOTCONT  = Total number of measured quarters of employment

TOTCNT01 = (0/1): Employed but with less than 2 measured quarters of employment

XGFCNERN = Earnings for the first measured quarter(s) of employment (initialized
           to $0)

XGLCNERN = Earnings for the last measured quarter(s) of employment (initialized
           to $0)

XLFGCDIF = Difference: last MINUS first measured quarter(s) of employment
           (initialized to $0)

LFGHGHER = (0/1): Increase of $100 or more from first to last measured
           quarter(s) of employment

LFGLOWER = (0/1): Decrease of $100 or more from first to last measured
           quarter(s) of employment

LFGNOCHG = (0/1): Change of less than +/- $100 from first to last measured
           quarter(s) of employment (=0 if VEMP2T21=0 [never employed] or if
           (TOTCNT01=1)

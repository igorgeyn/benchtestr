NOTE: Quarterly amounts were rounded to the nearest $100 to protect sample
members' confidentiality.  Values that ranged from $0.01 to $49.99 were set to
$100. Summary measures (for each follow-up year and for two or more
follow-up years) were calculated with these rounded quarterly totals.

$100. Summary measures (for each follow-up year and for two or more
follow-up years) were calculated with these rounded quarterly totals.

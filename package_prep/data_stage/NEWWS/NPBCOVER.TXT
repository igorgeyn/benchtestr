        GUIDE TO USING THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

   NATIONAL EVALUATION OF WELFARE-TO-WORK STRATEGIES (NEWWS) PUBLIC USE FILES


I. Introduction

This memo briefly describes the 6-CD set of public use analysis files and
accompanying documentation from the National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work
Strategies (NEWWS). The files contain the sample and outcome measures for
analyzing the effects of 11 welfare-to-work programs on a comprehensive series
of outcomes for adults and children. The 11 programs were operated during the
1990s in seven sites: Atlanta, Georgia; Columbus, Ohio; Detroit and Grand
Rapids, Michigan; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Portland, Oregon; and Riverside,
California.

Findings based on calculations with these data were presented in five reports
published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the
Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation and Administration for Children
and Families; and U.S. Department of Education, Office of the Under Secretary
and Office of Vocational and Adult Education:

These reports and public use files were prepared by the Manpower Demonstration
Research Corporation (MDRC) and Child Trends.  MDRC is conducting the NEWWS
Evaluation under a contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), funded by HHS under a competitive award, Contract No.
HHS-100-89-0030.  HHS is also receiving funding for the evaluation from the
U.S. Department of Education.  The study of one of the sites in the evaluation,
Riverside County (California), is also conducted under a contract from the
California Department of Social Services (CDSS). CDSS, in turn, is receiving
funding from the California State Job Training Coordinating Council, the
California Department of Education, HHS, and the Ford Foundation.

As part of the NEWWS Evaluation, Child Trends is conducting the Child Outcomes
Study under subcontract to MDRC.

II. Research Design for the NEWWS Evaluation

To test the effectiveness of welfare-to-work program strategies, the NEWWS
Evaluation uses an unusually strong research design: a random assignment
experiment. In each evaluation site, individuals who were required to
participate in the program were assigned, by chance, to either a program group,
which had access to employment and training services and whose members were
required to participate in the program or risk a reduction in their monthly
welfare grant, or to a control group, which received no services through the
program but whose members could seek out such services on their own from the
community.  Random assignment took place when welfare applicants and recipients
showed up at a welfare office to enroll in the site's welfare-to-work program.

This random assignment design assures that there are no systematic differences
between the background characteristics of program and control group members when
they enter the study. Thus, any subsequent differences in outcomes between the
groups (called impacts) can be attributed with confidence to the effects of the
program.

Four sites implemented a three-way random assignment research design in order
to test the relative effectiveness of two different program approaches. In the
three-way design, an individual is assigned, by chance, to either one of two
program groups or a control group. Members of the two program groups and the
control group are subject to the same labor market conditions and other
environmental factors, assuring that any differences in outcomes between the
two program groups, or between either program group and the control group, were
caused by the programs' design and implementation.

Three of these four sites (Atlanta, Grand Rapids, and Riverside) operated a
Labor Force Attachment (LFA) approach, which emphasized that the workplace is
where welfare recipients can best learn work habits and skills and thus tried
to place people in jobs quickly, even at low wages; and a Human Capital
Development (HCD) approach, which emphasized education and training as a
precursor to employment.  In Riverside, existing statewide rules mandated that
only individuals who were "in need of basic education"- defined as not having
a high school diploma or GED, having low scores on a welfare department math or
reading literacy test, or requiring English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL)
instruction- could be assigned to the HCD group. The LFA group in that
site, however, includes both those who were determined to be "in need"
and those "not in need."  (See memos that describe ways of estimating
program impacts for further discussion of this issue.)

Columbus used a three-way random assignment design to test the relative
effectiveness of two different case management models. In the Traditional model
the welfare department's employment and training and income maintenance
functions are handled by two different workers, both of whom maintain
relatively large caseloads. In the Integrated model one worker handles
both the employment and training and income maintenance functions.  The
integrated worker maintains
a smaller caseload than either of the traditional workers and is expected to
provide more intensive services.

The remaining three sites in the evaluation (Oklahoma City, Detroit, and
Portland) used random assignment to test the effectiveness of established
programs. Instead of implementing a program designed to meet research
protocols, as in the three-way sites, program administrators determined their
welfare-to-work program goals and practices and randomly assigned individuals
to either a group that entered the program or a non-program control group.

Individuals were randomly assigned to programs over approximately a two-year
period in each site.  The random assignment period for all sites includes the
years 1991 through 1994.

RECORD 14: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SAMPLE WEIGHTS


IV. Using the Data

Each sample member has a unique randomly-generated IDNUMBER (that varies from 1
to 44,569), which appears in columns 1-5 of each record of every file.
The same sample member IDNUMBER is used on every file in which she
(nearly all sample members are female) is included. Researchers may
build any number of research analysis files by merging records by
IDNUMBER. The Full Impact Sample File contains indicators of membership
in each of the key research samples.  These measures will be helpful in
constructing analysis files.

We strongly suggest that users of this file do the following before conducting
any further analyses with NEWWS Evaluation Public Use File data:

1. Read the _README files which give a brief description of all files included
   on each CD.

2. Read the reports, including chapters which describe the research designs,
   samples, and data sources.

3. Review the codebooks, file layouts, output, tables, and memos.

4. After reading the data into SAS or another statistical or econometric
   software package, replicate the sample sizes and means.


V. Maintaining Sample Members' Confidentiality

IDNUMBER is the only unique identifier in the NEWWS Evaluation Public Use Files.
Other background data that could be used to identify individual sample members
have been deleted or grouped into broader categories.  For example, the
year in which the sample member was randomly assigned is available to
researchers, but not her specific date of random assignment.  Values of some
outcome measures have also been deleted or grouped into broader categories to
protect sample members' confidentiality. For example, quarterly measures of
total earnings, welfare payments, and Food Stamp payments have been rounded
to the nearest $100.  See the cover memos and codebooks for each public use file
for more specific information on how data were changed.


IMPORTANT !!!: Researchers who estimate program impacts with the data from the
NEWWS Evaluation public use files will get slightly different results from
those published in NEWWS Evaluation reports.  Results will also differ
slightly from those which appear in the series of annotated tables stored on
each CD.  (Most of these tables are copied from reports.)

The cover memo for the Five-Year Full Impact Sample File contains a comparison
of impact estimates calculated with the original data and estimates calculated
with data stored on the NEWWS Evaluation public use files.


VI. Restricted Access Files

A copy of the original data used in the evaluation is available to researchers
(on a restricted access basis) at the National Center for Health Statistics.
See www.aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/newws/data-info.htm for more information.

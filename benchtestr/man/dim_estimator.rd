\title{
Estimate a treatment effect using the naive difference in means (DIM) estimator.}
\description{
This function allows for the estimation of a treatment effect given some dataset, an outcome variable, and a treatment variable. In the context of benchmarking experiemental findings, the DIM using experimental data is simply the difference in outcome means between the treatment while a benchmark control is obtained using an observational dataset.
}
\usage{
dim_estimator(df_exp, df_base, treatment, outcome)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{df_exp}{
     The experimental dataset to be benchmarked. Format as a dataframe object in R. This should include at least an outcome variable and a treatment variable.
}
  \item{df_base}{
     The observational dataset to be used for benchmarking. Format as a dataframe object in R. This should include at least an outcome variable and a treatment variable; should match the experimental dataset along both of these variables (name, variable type, etc.).
}
  \item{treatment}{
     The variable that indicates treatment assignment in both the experimental and the observational datasets. Should be identical in both datasets.
}
  \item{outcome}{
     The variable that indicates the outcome of interest in both the experimental and the observational datasets. Should be identical in both datasets.

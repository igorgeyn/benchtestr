## What is this?

This is a sandbox environment for some of the functions that were originally in the `first_functions` R script. It likely now includes functions from other places, but notably *not* those that were originally in `estimators`.

```{r}
# Nonparametric estimation of robustness value
# Slow, suggest putting R = 10 to test
require(sensemakr); require(boot); require(randomizr)
benchmakr_rvq = function(sensitivity_stats = "rv_q",
                         data = darfur,
                         formula = "peacefactor ~ directlyharmed + age + farmer_dar + herder_dar +
                         pastvoted + hhsize_darfur + female + village",
                         slice_prop = .5,
                         treatment = "directlyharmed",
                         bm_cov = "female",
                         kd = 1:3,
                         R = 250){
  slice = simple_ra(nrow(data), prob = slice_prop)
  boot_fun = function(data, slice){
    data = rbind(data, data[slice,])
    model = lm(formula = as.formula(formula), data = data)
    out = sensemakr(model, treatment = treatment, benchmark_covariates = bm_cov, kd = kd)
    #out = out[["sensitivity_stats"]][[sensitivity_stats]] %>% as.numeric()   # Not working, set "rv_q" by default
    out = out[["sensitivity_stats"]][["rv_q"]] %>% as.numeric()
    print(out)
  }
  out = boot(data = data, statistic = boot_fun, R = R, parallel = "multicore")
  print(out)
}

benchmakr_rvq_test = benchmakr_rvq(data = darfur, R = 10)
